## Moore and More

In this repository I collect data points to draw a nice diagram about
Moore's Law and especially how it changed to multicore. This was
originall created for the lecture
[Chip Multicore Processor](http://www.lis.ei.tum.de/?id=cmp). There
are only selected Intel cores and the idea is more to draw a
illustration, not a scientific diagram:

### How was data collected?

I collected the data mainly from Wikipedia and the Intel website. I
will add proper references later.

### How were processors selected?

There were no special scientific criteria defined, but I manually
selected a few representative processors for each generation.
